# LocationTask

LocationTask is a simple Android App. In this project, I used Google Maps SDK and Retrofit library for getting json objects. This app shows current location of device on map and calculates distance between current location and locations from endpoint.

Note : baseUrl is private. Therefore, this codes are not working.
